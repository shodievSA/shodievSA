<h2>Hi, I'm Abbos - a 19 y/o buider from Uzbekistan.</h2>

My philosophy is straightforward: build projects that solve my own problem in the first place. This approach might seem controversial, but I believe it is the only way to do a genuinely great job as a developer.

I usually bring my ideas into life through web-based apps or telegram bots but I am open to learning new tools and domains. If you have a project idea that you want to discuss, feel free to contact me.
