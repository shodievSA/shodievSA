## Hi, I'm Abbos - a 20 y.o builder from Uzbekistan.

My philosophy is straightforward: build projects that solve my own problem in the first place. This approach might seem controversial, but I believe it is the only way to do a genuinely great job as a developer.

I usually bring my ideas into life through web-based apps or telegram bots but I am open to learning new tools and domains. If you have a project idea that you want to discuss, feel free to contact me.

## Some projects I contributed to:

#### [YuristAI](https://github.com/javoxirone/yuristai-client-side) - web-based chat app for receiving legal information in Uzbekistan:
- Designed and developed login & signup pages from scratch.
- Implemented JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication.
- Integrated AI assistant (chatgpt-3.5-turbo).
- Added feedback system.
- Worked closely with backend developers to setup API endpoints and handle their responses.

#### [UpdateHelper](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/updatehelper/hgkmpgodmnpfbcfpicchlpgiigknppnl?hl=en) - chrome extension designed for Amazon Relay dispatchers to manage loads efficiently:
- Enhanced the UI & UX to ensure intuitive design.
- Resolved issues related to JWT management, ensuring secure authentication and session handling.
- Fixed client-side routing bugs to improve navigation and application stability.
